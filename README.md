HP Indigo 7900 Supply Usage Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I combined data cleaning with Python and visualization with Tableau to analyze monthly supply usage for the HP Indigo 7900 press.

As a student worker and press operator with a background in IT, I created this project for personal use to better understand supply consumption trends and optimize resource tracking.

⚙️ Workflow

Raw Data Preparation

Started with an uncleaned/unstructured Excel file containing supply usage records.

Removed unnecessary fields and irrelevant entries.

Filled in missing values to ensure data consistency.

Data Cleaning (Python)

Processed the Excel file using Python (pandas).

Converted raw date values into monthly buckets for better time-series analysis.

Exported the final dataset into a new structured Excel file.

Data Visualization (Tableau)

Used the cleaned dataset to build interactive dashboards in Tableau.

Visualized supply usage per month to identify patterns and trends.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas) → Data cleaning and preprocessing

Excel → Source and cleaned datasets

Tableau → Interactive visualizations

📊 Visualization Highlights

Monthly trends in supply usage.

Clear representation of consumption patterns.

Supports decision-making for press operations and inventory tracking.

🚀 How to Use

Open the raw Excel file.

Run the Python script to generate a cleaned dataset.

✨ Key Learnings

Hands-on experience with data wrangling and cleaning.

Converting raw operational data into actionable insights.

Strengthening knowledge in Python (data preprocessing) and Tableau (visual storytelling).

📌 Future Improvements

Automate data extraction and cleaning pipeline.

Add more detailed breakdowns by supply type.

Integrate with a live dashboard for real-time updates.

Load the cleaned dataset into Tableau.

Explore the Tableau dashboard to view monthly usage insights.
